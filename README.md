# Project Description

Our goal is to help the Sony Analytics team by giving them the tools necessary to analyze trends in the movie industry in order to help Sony determine which movies they should invest more money into. Specifically, we will be analyzing genre-based investment decisions. We are addressing a possible lack of insight into the performance of specific genres, and how this should be influencing decision making in the entertainment business. To commbat these issues, we will be analyzing factors such as revenues generated by films, time of year films are released, the runtime of specific movies, as well as the budget of movies. This project is inspired by a [job post](https://github.com/LMU-MSBA/Sony-Analytics-Hub/blob/main/docs/proposal/Sony_Analyst.pdf) from Sony Pictures Entertainment, titled "Analyst, Data Management & Reporting." Consequently, we feel this project is a perfect fit for the industry of the data we are looking at as well as the analysis we will be conducting on it.
