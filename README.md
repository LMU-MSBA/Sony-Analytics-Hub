# Project Description

Our goal is to help the Sony Analytics team by giving them the tools necessary to analyze trends in the movie industry in order to help Sony determine which movies they should invest more money into. Specifically, we will be analyzing genre-based investment decisions. We are addressing a possible lack of insight into the performance of specific genres, and how this should be influencing decision making in the entertainment business. To commbat these issues, we will be analyzing factors such as revenues generated by films, time of year films are released, the runtime of specific movies, as well as the budget of movies. This project is inspired by a [job post](https://github.com/LMU-MSBA/Sony-Analytics-Hub/blob/main/docs/proposal/Sony_Analyst.pdf) from Sony Pictures Entertainment, titled "Analyst, Data Management & Reporting." Consequently, we feel this project is a perfect fit for the industry of the data we are looking at as well as the analysis we will be conducting on it.


# Project Structure
### The following are the sections of the project:
[**Code:**](https://github.com/LMU-MSBA/Sony-Analytics-Hub/tree/main/code/dashboards) This folder will include all of the code used in the data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and modeling performed.

[**Dashboards:**](https://github.com/LMU-MSBA/Sony-Analytics-Hub/tree/main/dashboards) The visualizations created on the interactive dashboards using Tableau.

[**Data:**](https://github.com/LMU-MSBA/Sony-Analytics-Hub/tree/main/data) Both the raw and cleaned dataset obtained from Kaggle on the movie industry. This dataset includes important information about specific movies such as revenue, runtime, release date, etc. 

[**Documents:**](https://github.com/LMU-MSBA/Sony-Analytics-Hub/tree/main/docs) This section will contain the any necessary documentation such as the project's report or the job posting that this project is based on.

[**Models:**](https://github.com/LMU-MSBA/Sony-Analytics-Hub/tree/main/models) Any models, test or final, that are created to analyze the dataset.

[**Presentations:**](https://github.com/LMU-MSBA/Sony-Analytics-Hub/tree/main/presentations) Contains the pdf files of the presentations conducted based on the analysis done on the data.

# Analytics Maturity Scale
### Aspire
In this phase, we do very initial analysis of the data gathered, centered around the genre of movies. Deliverables for this would include some initial descriptive statistics of the data, as well as some graphs or charts of data trends. At this stage of the project, we are just trying to glimpse the data's value.
### Mature
In this stage of the data analytics scale, we are trying to climpse the data quality as well as determine a single source of truth. We will do more in depth analysis to find more in depth reasoning behind the trends we initially found. Deliverables for this phase would include an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD), as well as a structured data warehouse to do analysis on.
### Industrialize
This phase of the analystics maturity scale will include automation and scaling. Deliverables for this section will include an ETL pipeline as well as a diagnostic analytics dashboard.
### Realize
This stage will include the creation of a predictive model, based on machine learning algorithms. The deliverable for this section will be the finished model itself.
### Differentiate
This phase typically inlcudes innovation, as well as data literacy from the top-down in the company. For this project, the deliverable for this section would be a data manifesto.
