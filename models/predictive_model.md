# Predictive Model

## Description
This final model created for this project is a decision tree classifier. The inputs to the model are different features of a specific film, such as the month it is planning to be released or the genre of the movie. The model then predicts the revenue category the film should fall into, in one of four categories:

1. Low
2. Medium
3. High
4. Very High

## Input Features

After the data was cleaned and prepped to be used in a predictive model, we were left with nine variables (eight excluding the categorized_rev label column).
