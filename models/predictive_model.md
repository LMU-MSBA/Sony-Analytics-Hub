# Predictive Model

## Description
This final model created for this project is a decision tree classifier. The inputs to the model are different features of a specific film, with things such as the month it is planning to be released, or the genre of the movie, and then the model predicts the revenue category of the film in one of four categories:

1. Low
2. Medium
3. High
4. Very High

## Input Features

After the data was cleaned and prepped to be used in a predictive model, we were left with nine variables (eight excluding the categorized_rev label column).
