# Business Problem Definition

## Determine Business Objectives

### Background
The film industry is highly competitive, and production companies are constantly trying to find new ways to get the best return on their investments. That is why is it so important to be able to understand trends in the film industry in order to make strategic decisions as well as gain a competitive advantage over competitors. 

### Business Activity Category
The business activity category that best suits the goals and direction of this project is the Strategy section. Although ultimately the goal would be to increase revenues, the more defined objective is to be able to analyze the trends in the movie industry to give Sony Pictures the tools to make informed decisions on how to best imrpove their methods.

### Assumptions & Constraints
- Assumptions
  - The data we are using should not require any licensing since it was a dataset public on Kaggle
  - We also must assume that the data we pulled from the database is accurate, so our conclusions are based on correct numbers
- Constraints
  - Time
  - Finding time to meet and work as a group since we are all busy with work and class separately
### Terminology

### Costs & Benefits

If we were doing this project from the point of view of Sony Pictures, then the cost would be the money spent on our group's time spent working on the project. For example, if each of us were being paid $20/hr of work by Sony, then the total price of the project would be $80xTime in Hours Billed. The reason it is $80 is since there are four of us in the group working on the project. There are no other expenses for this project as we already have the software necessary and the data was public, we did not have to pay to get it.

There is no way of saying how much money that Sony Pictures would get directly from this project. Instead, the gains would be the insights generated based around the analysis of genre. Examples of use of those insights would be figuring out which genres are more valuable to invest into, what time of year to release certain genres of film, etc. Even though the ultimate goal is to increase revenues, we are focused here on strategy as our business activity category. A general goal would be to improve stratgey based on the insights of the project in order to best imrpove ROI.
