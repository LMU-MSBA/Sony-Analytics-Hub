# A/B Testing Plan for Sony Website Popup Windows

## Metrics:
Key performance metrics for measuring user engagement:
1. **Click-through Rate (CTR):** the percentage of users who click on the popup windows to view more information about the upcoming action movies or watch their trailers.
2. **Trailer Views:** the number of views for each trailer embedded within the popup windows.
3. **Conversion Rate:** the percentage of users who take desired actions after interacting with the popup windows, purchasing tickets for the featured movies or adding them to their watchlists.

## Business Question:
Will increasing user engagement with upcoming action movies lead to a significant increase in sales of action movies?

## Hypotheses:
- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no significant difference in user engagement metrics between the control group (no popup windows) and the experimental group (popup windows).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The introduction of popup windows featuring upcoming action movies and their trailers leads to a significant increase in user engagement metrics.

## Experimental Design:
- **Description of Control and Experimental Groups:**
  - *Control Group:* Users who do not see popup windows featuring upcoming action movies and their trailers.
  - *Experimental Group:* Users who are presented with popup windows showcasing upcoming action movies and their trailers.
- **Randomization Process:** Users are randomly assigned to either the control or experimental group to ensure that the groups are representative of the overall user population.
- **Duration of the Experiment:** The experiment will run for 3 months to capture sufficient data and observe trends in user engagement over time.
- **Sample Size Calculation:** 

## Implementation Plan:
- **Technical Requirements:** Google Optimize for designing, executing, and analyzing A/B tests and Google Analytics for tracking user interactions with the popup windows and analyze their impact 

## Timeline: 
- **Planning Phase (1-2 weeks):** Define the objectives and hypotheses, determine specific metrics, and create an implementation plan.
- **Design and Setup Phase (2-3 weeks):** Design popup windows, develop necessary code, and integrate A/B testing platform.
- **Testing (1 week):** Conduct thorough testing of popup windows and experiment setup.
- **Launch and Data Collection (4-6 weeks):** Run the experiment, collect data, and monitor user interactions.
- **Analysis and Interpretation (2-3 weeks):** Analyze results, evaluate statistical significance, and interpret findings.
- **Reporting and Actionable Insights (1-2 weeks):** Compile report, present findings, and provide recommendations.
- **Iterative Optimization (Ongoing):** iterating on design and strategy for continuous improvement as well as monitoring user engagement metrics and conduct additional experiments.

## Ethical Considerations:
- Ensure transparency, user consent, and minimal disruption to browsing experience.
- Respect user privacy, handle data responsibly, and adhere to relevant regulations.

## Data Collection and Analysis:
- **Data Collection:** 
  - Collect data on user interaction metrics, segment users, and ensure data integrity.
- **Data Analysis:** 
  - Conduct descriptive analysis, evaluate statistical significance, and lastly visualize.
