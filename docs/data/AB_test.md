# A/B Testing Plan for Sony Website Popup Windows

## Metrics:
Key performance metrics for measuring user engagement:
1. **Click-through Rate (CTR):** The percentage of users who click on the popup windows to receive alerts when ticket sales open for upcoming action movies or to watch their trailers.
2. **Trailer Views:** the number of views for each trailer embedded within the popup windows.
3. **Conversion Rate:** the percentage of users who take desired actions after interacting with the popup windows. This includes purchasing tickets for the featured movies or.

## Business Question:
Will increasing user engagement with upcoming action movies lead to a significant increase in sales of action movies?

## Hypotheses:
- **Null Hypothesis (H0):** There is no significant difference in user engagement metrics between the control group (no popup windows) and the experimental group (popup windows).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1):** The introduction of popup windows featuring upcoming action movies and their trailers leads to a significant increase in user engagement metrics.

## Experimental Design:
- **Description of Control and Experimental Groups:**
  - *Control Group:* Users who do not see popup windows featuring upcoming action movies and their trailers.
  - *Experimental Group:* Users who are presented with popup windows showcasing upcoming action movies and their trailers.
- **Randomization Process:** Users are randomly assigned to either the control or experimental group to ensure that the groups are representative of the overall user population.
- **Duration of the Experiment:** The experiment will run for 3 months to capture sufficient data and observe trends in user engagement over time.
- **Sample Size Calculation:**  The sample size will be determined based on the expected effect size, statistical power (typically 0.80), and significance level (typically 0.05), ensuring that the A/B test has sufficient sensitivity to detect meaningful differences in user engagement metrics between the control and experimental groups.

## Implementation Plan:
- **Technical Requirements:** With Optimizely, we can efficiently conduct A/B testing, multivariate testing, and personalization campaigns to optimize user experiences and inform strategic decisions.

## Timeline: 
**Preparing and Designing (3-5 weeks):** Defining objectives and metrics, designing popup windows, and integrating Optimizely. 
**Running the Test (4-6 weeks):** Conducting tests on various devices, launching the A/B test, and collecting user interaction data. 
**Analyzing and Interpreting (3-5 weeks):** Analyzing results, comparing performance, and drawing conclusions.

## Ethical Considerations:
- **Informed Consent** - providing users with clear and transparent information about the experiments being conducted on the website and obtaining their explicit consent before they participate.
- **User Privacy** - safeguarding users' personal information, respecting their preferences, and ensuring transparency about data practices.
- **Fair Treatment** - Ensure that the popup window is presented to all users in a fair and equitable manner. Avoid targeting specific user segments based on sensitive attributes such as race, gender, or socioeconomic status.


## Data Collection and Analysis:
- **Data Collection:** 
  - Collect data on user interaction metrics, segment users, and ensure data integrity.
- **Data Analysis:** 
  - Conduct descriptive analysis, evaluate statistical significance, and lastly visualize.
