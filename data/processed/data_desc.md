# Data Description

This is the cleaned version of the dataset pulled from Kaggle. Because revenue was an important factor that we wanted to further explore, we created a new column from the revenue column called, "categorized revenue." This allowed us to be able to create a predictive model that could choose which revenue category a movie would be in based on a few factors.
